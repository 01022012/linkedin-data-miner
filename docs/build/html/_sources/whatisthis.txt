What Is LinkedIn Data Miner?
============================

LinkedIn Data Miner is a python script that automates the gathering of company information from a LinkedIn company page, `like ours <http://www.linkedin.com/company/intridea-inc>`_!

Starting with a MongoDB database full of companies with a LinkedIn company page URL, it will automatically get the following for each company in your database:

* Description
* Specialties
* Address
* Website
* Type
* Founded
* Industry
* Company size

It then takes this information and updates the company record.
